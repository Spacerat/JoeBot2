Which layer {1}?
The {0} {1}.


Troposphere	contains the majority of the air, weather systems are found here, temperature ranges from an average of 14°C at ground level to -52°C
Tropopause	marks the boundary between the troposphere & stratosphere
Stratosphere	has a temperature which increases as altitude increases, from -52°C to -3°C due to the absorption of UV radiation
Ozone layer	is found in the stratosphere and absorbs certain wavelengths of UV radiation, UV-A & UV-B. This helps to regulate planetary temperature and helps reduce the UV radiation from damaging DNA molecules in living things causing cancer.
Stratopause	marks the boundary between the stratosphere & mesosphere
Mesosphere	has a temperature which decreases as altitude increases, falling to -94°C at the top of the layer
Mesopause	marks the boundary between the mesosphere & thermosphere
Thermosphere	has a temperature which rises with altitude, rising to as high as 1727°C depending on solar activity. This is due to the absorption of solar radiation by the remaining oxygen molecules
Exosphere	is the transition layer between the outermost reach of the atmosphere and interplanetary space and has an extremely low density of molecules.
